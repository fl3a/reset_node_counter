# Reset node statistices counter (reset_node_counter)

## Introduction

This set of modules and drush integration allows you to reset the node_counter which increments a counter each time content is viewed.
This counter is part of Drupal cores statistic module .

This might be useful, if you refine your unpublished content online and you want to start with 0 views on a published node.

So Reset node counter provides you
* A checkbox on node edit form
* Drush integration
* Bulk operations via VBO

### Checkbox

The reset_node_counter module add a 'Reset node counter' checkbox to 'Publishing options' tab/fieldset
of drupalÂ´s node edit form.
When checked it deletes the record within the node_counter table for this specific node
after node/edit form submission.

### Drush Integration

Module reset_node_counter also has a drush integration...
Just pass the nid of corresponding node to reset-node-counter drush command
and it wipes the entry of the corresponding node from node_counter table.

    drush reset-node-counter $NID 

### Bulk Operations

The **Reset node counter VBO** module allows you to reset the node counter on many nodes via [Views Bulk Operations (VBO)](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_bulk_operations) 
and[Adminstration views (admin_views)](http://drupal.org/project/admin_views).

It introduces a reset action and a default view based on the admin_views_node view from admin_view module which already includes this new action as operation.

Access the view at admin/content and use _Reset node statistics counter_ operation.
